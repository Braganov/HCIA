# HCIA - Holberton Central Intelligence Agency

Hello holbies,

Your mission, if you accept it, is to create an optimal class system for generate secret mission for an information service.

Here your instructions :

1. Clone this repository
2. Check you have node in your computer with the node --version command. We need npm (node package manager) to give you your material.
3. Run the command npm install for install all dependencies you need. These dependencies are specified in the package.json file. When you will run the npm install command, it will install all dependencies specified in this file, in our case only jest tool.
4. Read the mission_generator.test.js for understand what we expect from you
5. Do your mission in the mission_generator.js file. 
6. Here is the [manual](https://javascript.info/) for help you to understand your weapon

**Disclaimer** : You are secrets agents, don't forget to not share any informations with Claude (clin d'oeil clin d'oeil) or other AI which is now in the hands of the enemy.

We ask you a feedback about your work at the end of the day. 
For a continuous improvement of our team, you will share your good practices applied during your mission.

If you fail your mission, Holberton will deny knowing you.

Finally, we ask you to listen this [track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAYhNHhxN0A) during your mission. 

Good luck, holbies.
